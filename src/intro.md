# Modeling uncertainty

### General problem

**Quantity of interest**

$$\begin{equation*}
\bf{Z}=g(\bf{X}),\quad \bf{X}=(X_{1},\ldots, X_{d})
\end{equation*}$$

- $X_{i}$ are random variables
- $X_{i}$ represent *uncertain risk factors*

### Examples

. . .

#### portfolio return
- individual stocks $(X_{1},\ldots, X_{d})$
- $g$ is aggregation function

. . .

#### option payoff

- single underlying $X_{1}$
- $g$ is payoff function


### Certain future payments

- in the simplest case, all risk factors $(X_{1},\ldots, X_{d})$ are
  perfectly known

. . . 

#### Example: bank account

- *bank account* with given interest rate


### Aggregation

- even without uncertainty, our quantity of interest commonly implies
  a *multi-dimensional* setting

. . .

#### Example: multi-period wealth

- *multi-period wealth* calculation with given annual interest rates


## Interest and compounding

### Interest and Compounding

- given an interest rate of $r$ per period and initial wealth $W_{t}$,
  the wealth one period ahead is calculated as 

	$$\begin{equation*}
	W_{t+1}=W_{t}\left(1+r\right)
	\end{equation*}$$

. . .

#### Example

- $r=0.05$ (annual rate), $W_{0}=500.000$, after one year

. . .

$$500.000\left(1+\frac{5}{100}\right)= 500.000\left(1+0.05\right)=525.000$$


### Next slides

- compound interest in general:

	$$ W_{T}(r,W_{0})=W_{0}(1+r)^{T} $$


### 

- interest rate aggregation
- log interest rate aggregation

- relation: log interest rates as limit of discrete interest rates 


### Returns

- non-stationarity: look at returns, not prices
- going back to prices naturally involves aggregation 

# Interest rates and returns

###

two broad types of investments:

. . .

#### fixed-income assets

- payments are known in advance 
- only risk is risk of losses due to the failure of a counterparty
  to fulfill its contractual obligations: called credit risk 

. . .

#### speculative assets

- characterized by random price movements
- modelled in a stochastic framework using random variables
